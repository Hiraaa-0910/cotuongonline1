## Console Debug Checklist

When something doesn't work, check these in console:

```javascript
// Are pieces loaded?
coTuongGame.activePieces.length >= 32
// Result: true

// Are captured areas ready?
document.getElementById('capturedRed') !== null
document.getElementById('capturedBlack') !== null
// Result: true

// Can we find a piece?
document.querySelector('.quan-co')
// Result: <div> element

// Is board ready?
document.getElementById('chessBoard')
// Result: <div> element

// Is game initialized?
coTuongGame
// Result: CoTuongHoanChinh object
```

## Files to Check

- ✅ **hoan-chinh-co-tuong.js** - Everything is here

- ✅ **js/main.js** - Connects to game engine
- ✅ **js/game.js** - Disabled (not used)
- ✅ **js/chess-game.js** - Disabled (not used)

## Most Important Things

1. **Open Developer Console (F12)**
   - This shows you exactly what's happening
   - You'll see if capture works or fails
   - Error messages tell you what's wrong

2. **Watch Console Output**
   - `⚔️` = Capture in progress
   - `✅` = Step completed successfully
   - `❌` = Step failed
   - `⚠️` = Warning (something unusual)

3. **Check Game Board**
   - Does piece move? Yes = ✓
   - Does captured piece disappear? Yes = ✓
   - Does captured piece appear in section? Yes = ✓

4. **Check Turn**
   - Status should change after each move
   - Turn indicator should switch colors
