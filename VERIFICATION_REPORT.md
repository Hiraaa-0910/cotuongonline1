## Key Implementation Details

### Turn Enforcement (Critical Fix)
```javascript
xuLyClickQuanCo(quanCo) {
    const mau = quanCo.dataset.mau;
    if (mau !== this.currentPlayer) {
        // Piece doesn't belong to current player
        // Show error message
        // Return without processing
        return;
    }
    // Process piece selection
}
```

### Piece Selection Clearing (Critical Fix)
```javascript
boChon() {
    // Remove visual highlight
    // Clear selected piece reference
    // Reset valid moves
    // Remove move highlights
    // Prevent accidental repeat moves
}
```

### Move Execution Sequence
```javascript
diChuyenQuanCo(hangDich, cotDich) {
    // 1. Validate move
    // 2. Capture if applicable
    // 3. Move piece
    // 4. Record history
    // 5. Switch turns ← AUTOMATIC
    // 6. Clear selection ← AUTOMATIC
    // 7. Check for check
}
```
